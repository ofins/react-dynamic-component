## Usage

1. Modify the `src/components` directory to add or update child components.
2. Use the parent component in `App.js` to dynamically render children based on your requirements.

Example:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ChildComponent from "./components/ChildComponent";

function App() {
  const children = [<ChildComponent key={1} />, <ChildComponent key={2} />];

  return <div>{children}</div>;
}

export default App;
```

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

The optimized build will be available in the `build/` directory.
